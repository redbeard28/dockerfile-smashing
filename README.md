# README #

This is a template Ansible playbook structure.
It is designed to be the base for new Ansible Playbook projects setting out a folder structure along the lines of Ansible best practices guidelines.
Any suggestions for improvements to this use the issue queue or tweet me @ibluebag

## Usage

Download this (as opposed to cloning it) to form the base of a new project.
Edit as required and update the readme specific to your project.
A sample base role is provided that you can use.
To create new roles use the following command in terminal within the roles directory.
````
ansible-galaxy init 'newrolename'
````
and that will create a role folder structure for you to use.

Ansible best practices can be read about here: http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_best_practices.html

I strongly recommend purchasing a copy of the Ansible for Devops book by Jeff Geerling
